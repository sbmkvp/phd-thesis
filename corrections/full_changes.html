<span class="f2">+\begin{itemize}</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Active vs Passive Collection} - Active collection is where the data collection process involves the active participation from the study subjects. In passive data collection, no such participation is required. For example, a web form based survey is an active data collection process while a script collecting data on user's data on a website is passive. This shall not be confused with primary and secondary data where the difference is mainly due to who collects the data from the source.
+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Anonymisation and Pseudonymisation } - The act of removing personal or identifiable information from the data. For example, removing the names and date of birth of people in a dataset. Anonymisation could be carried out in various ways two most popular approaches are generalisation and perturbation. Pseudonymisation is similar but the personally identifiable data is substituted with artificial identifier. The difference between them is that in anonymisation the personal information is permanently purged and there is no way of getting the information back. De-anonymisation is the reverse process of getting personal identifiable data from anonymised data.
+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Big Data} - Generally defined as data which could not be handled with regularly used tools and techniques. There are more nuanced definitions of big data depending on the dimension, context and industry. These concepts are discussed in detail in Section \ref{section:toolkit}.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Bluetooth} - Short wavelength, low energy, short range wireless technology used for transferring data between electronic devices. They are generally used by mobile devices to connect to peripherals.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{CDRC} - The Consumer Data Research Center is an investment from Economic Social Research Center, UK for working with consumer-related organisations to open up their data resources to trusted researchers thus enabling them to carry out important social and economic research.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Cellular/Mobile Network} - Terrestrial, long range and wireless network which provides connectivity to mobile devices embedded in them. Most commonly used to denote the networks that provides telephony and internet services to mobile devices using radio waves.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Cryptographic Hashing} - This is the process of transforming a variable set of characters or contents of a file into a fixed length string (checksum). The process is usually one way and is not reversible without a rainbow attack using a database of checksums of all possible values. This is generally used for storing user passwords and to verify the integrity/ authenticity of data. In this thesis hashing functions are used for the purpose of anonymisaiton</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Data Partner} - Local Data Company - the organisation which developed the Smart Street Sensor project in conjunction with CDRC. The organisation is solely responsible for the design, manufacture, installation and maintenance of the Smart Street Sensors.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Device Fingerprinting} - This is the process of identifying devices through forensic analysis. This commonly used to identify users from data collected by operational websites. This commonly done through identifying unique configurations of the devices such as screen sizes, versions of software installed, etc. In this thesis fingerprinting is used to denote such processes where unique devices are identified from randomised data.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Encryption} - This is the process of converting a information into unintelligible format using an algorithm (cipher) to prevent unauthorised access. The process is two way since the resulting cipher-text can be decrypted to restore information. The most common methods used is a public-key based encryption scheme known as 'Diffie Hellman key exchange'.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Footfall} - Number of people at a given location at a give time. In this thesis the term is used synonymous to footfall at a high street - which is only the pedestrians walking along the particular sidewalk of the high street and does not include people on the carriage way in vehicles.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{High Street} - The primary business street in a town or a local area where most shops and commercial activity are located. This term is often used to contrast and distinguish from 'Shopping centers' which are large designated areas earmarked for retail activity exclusively.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Localisation} - Though localisation could mean both GSM localisation and indoor positioning where the location of a device is indirectly derived from other information, in this thesis localisation is used mainly in the context of indoor positioning of mobile devices using techniques other than GPS. The localisation of objects is often relative to each other or to an object with an established position.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Location, Sensor and Install} - In this thesis and the Smart Street Sensor project, 'location' refers to a physical or geographic location in United Kingdom, 'sensor' denotes the electronic equipment used to collect data and 'install' refers to the time when a particular sensor was operating from a particular location.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Mobile Device} - A portable computing device such as a smartphone or tablet computer. This also includes wearables and other devices which have computing hardware and can operate independently of another device.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Personally Identifiable Information} - Any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used for de-anonymizing anonymous data can be considered personally identifiable information. In this thesis, the Media Access Control address is considered as sensitive personally identifiable information.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+</span><span class="b1">    </span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Positioning} - Positioning is the measurement of the absolute position (coordinates) of an object with reference to the earth. This is usually achieved through the use of Global Positioning System or similar systems.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Probe Request} - This is a special signal broadcast by Wi-Fi enabled mobile devices to elicit a response (probe response) from Wi-Fi access points which can receive them. The primary purpose of the probe request is to enumerate the available Wi-Fi networks and there can also be secondary purposes such as indoor positioning.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Real-time} - This is highly subjective concept which could be defined as the phenomena which occurs sufficiently immediately. In this thesis real-time is used to describe data which is collected within an hour after the event has occurred.</span>
<span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Sensor Configuration} - The way the sensor is installed at a particular location. This includes the this includes the position of the sensor in terms of height and depth, the material of shopfront etc.</span>

<span class="f2">+\citep{vanhoef2016} presents several novel methods of abusing the features of the Wi-Fi standards to track mobile devices even when the MAC addresses were randomised. This research shows the possibility of using the information elements present in the probe requests along with the sequence numbers to fingerprint the mobile device which sent the request with an accuracy of the 50\% within a 20 minute interval with a possibility of improvement with known scrambler 'seeds' - the randomisation factor used by popular commercial devices. Though this sounds promising for short intervals, since this research, manufacturers have stopped including non-mandatory information elements which can affect the accuracy significantly. The research also features two other methods to reverse engineer the original MAC addresses from the randomised ones - first where known hotspots were spoofed to trick the mobile devices in revealing their real addresses and the second where a different protocol requests were used. Both these methods cannot be used extensively since the former is not ethically sound and the latter is not widely used by all mobile devices.</span><span class="b1">

<span class="f2">+we have demonstrated that the task is indeed feasible, using Wi-Fi probe requests. Even when the identity of the devices were masked using randomisation techniques we have demonstrated that aggregation and estimation could be done without compromising the privacy of the users.</span>
<span class="f2">+In addition to this, we have also demonstrated the usefulness and application of such footfall estimate with various examples.</span>
<span class="f2">+The footfall estimates derived from the method were used to devise a 'footfall index' at various levels - national, city, area and micro site locations showing how the retail related footfall have been distributed in the UK and how this distribution has been changing over time in high granularity both spatially and temporally.</span>

<span class="f2">+As we discussed in the literature review, the research on collecting and using data on population distribution and dynamics have closely followed the advances and changes in the consumer technology.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+Every new technology adopted for mainstream use spurred new wave of research in using those technology.</span>
<span class="f2">+It is also noted that every new technology not only brought many advantages over the previous ones but also introduced unique challenges.</span>
<span class="f2">+In this context, the larges opportunity in furthering the research exists in identifying, evaluating and adopting new technologies.</span>
<span class="f2">+There is a significant opportunities in applying these new technologies for old challenges and device methods to make them suitable to answer the questions raised by research.</span>
<span class="f2">+Few such technologies are detailed below,</span>

<span class="f2">+\begin{itemize}</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{5G} is the new generation of technology which aims to bring even higher speeds of data transfer to mobile devices through cellular networks. This may lead to the gradual decline and phasing out of Wi-Fi technology. Though this cellular based technology doesn't provide the similar detail and flexibility offered by Wi-Fi it has the potential to offer much more comprehensive picture of the world if it gets  widely adopted.</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Bluetooth Low energy (BLE)} is the upcoming short-range, wireless personal area network technology. With emphasis on being the technology used by the Internet of Things (IOT) devices, this technology has the potential to displace Wi-Fi as the choice of short-range communications. The explosion of wearables and smart devices at home, the amount of data that could be available form this technology could be staggering in the next decade.</span>
<span class="f2">+  \item \textbf{Ultra wide band radar} is another short-range technology which has been developed for motion and object detection. Being primarily used to design sensors for proximity and motion detection, this has the potential to become a standard for vehicles. Moreover, with the recent uptick in self driving car research and development, the cost of these devices has gone significantly down thus providing amazing opportunities in creating comprehensive sensor networks similar to Smart Street Sensor project.</span>

<span class="f2">+There is also opportunity for researching on the uncertainties and limits of datasets when subject to robust privacy control methods.</span>
<span class="f2">+Secondly the immense research, innovation and advancements made in peer to peer technologies in solving the various trust problems could be applied in the field of sensor based population estimation or pedestrian flow detection.</span>
<span class="f2">+There is an opportunity for research into building a peer to peer network of sensors where the data collected by the sensors never leave the device themselves but the analyses are taken to the source of data.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+This act of &quot;moving the analysis to data&quot; can solve numerous problems of safety of the personal data since there is not central point of failure and it can also scale up indefinitely without overwhelming a central repository of data.</span>
<span class="f2">+Through these further research, we could take the field forward by not only following the improvements in the technology of data collection but also push the envelope in terms of developing more ethical and sage research environment while handling large amounts of data.</span>

<span class="f2">+We present several novel techniques to track (unassociated) mobile devices by abusing features of the Wi-Fi standard. This shows that using random MAC addresses, on its own, does not guarantee privacy.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+First, we show that information elements in probe requests can be used to fingerprint devices. We then combine these fingerprints with incremental sequence numbers, to create a tracking algorithm that does not rely on unique identi- fiers such as MAC addresses. Based on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly track as much as 50% of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also show that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scram- bler seeds. These can be used to improve the performance of our tracking algorithm. Finally, we present two attacks that reveal the real MAC address of a device, even if MAC ad- dress randomization is used. In the first one, we create fake hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real MAC address. The second technique relies on the new 802.11u standard, commonly referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we show that Linux and Windows send Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) requests using their real MAC address.</span><span class="b1"> </span>

<span class="f2">+MAC address randomization is a common privacy protec- tion measure deployed in major operating systems today. It is used to prevent user-tracking with probe requests that are transmitted during IEEE 802.11 network scans. We present an attack to defeat MAC address randomization through observation of the timings of the network scans with an off- the-shelf Wi-Fi interface. This attack relies on a signature based on inter-frame arrival times of probe requests, which is used to group together frames coming from the same de- vice although they use distinct MAC addresses. We propose several distance metrics based on timing and use them to- gether with an incremental learning algorithm in order to group frames. We show that these signatures are consistent over time and can be used as a pseudo-identifier to track devices. Our framework is able to correctly group frames using different MAC addresses but belonging to the same device in up to 75% of the cases. These results show that the timing of 802.11 probe frames can be abused to track individual devices and that address randomization alone is not always enough to protect users against tracking.</span><span class="b1"> 
</span><span class="f2">+</span>
<span class="f2">+Martin</span>
<span class="f2">+Media Access Control (MAC) address ran- domization is a privacy technique whereby mobile de- vices rotate through random hardware addresses in or- der to prevent observers from singling out their traffic or physical location from other nearby devices. Adop- tion of this technology, however, has been sporadic and varied across device manufacturers. In this paper, we present the first wide-scale study of MAC address ran- domization in the wild, including a detailed breakdown of different randomization techniques by operating sys- tem, manufacturer, and model of device.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+We then identify multiple flaws in these implementa- tions which can be exploited to defeat randomization as performed by existing devices. First, we show that devices commonly make improper use of randomization by sending wireless frames with the true, global address when they should be using a randomized address. We move on to extend the passive identification techniques of Vanhoef et al. to effectively defeat randomization in ∼96% of Android phones. Finally, we identify a previ- ously unknown flaw in the way wireless chipsets handle low-level control frames which applies to 100% of de- vices we tested. This flaw permits an active attack that can be used under certain circumstances to track any existing wireless device.</span><span class="b1"> </span>

<span class="f2">+Wi-Fi has imposed itself as one of the key radio technology in portable devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other wearable devices. Because they periodically scan for nearby access points, Wi-Fi devices act as portable radio beacons emitting short messages, called probe requests. The latter contain a unique identifier: the MAC address of the Wi-Fi interface. It can be used to passively track individuals. Owners of such devices are thus exposed to passive tracking in the physical world.</span><span class="b1"> </span>
<span class="f2">+MAC address randomization has been proposed as a way to prevent passive tracking, and is being progressively adopted by the industry. However, the MAC address is not the only piece of information that can be used for tracking. For instance, it has been recently shown that exploiting the content of frames as well as their timing could still lead to tracking despite MAC address randomization.</span><span class="b1"> </span>

<span class="f2">+This paper presents a new simple mobile tracking system based on IEEE802.11 wireless signal detection, which can be used for analyzing the movement of pedestrian traffic. Wi-Fi packets emitted by Wi-Fi enabled smartphones are received at a monitoring station and these packets contain date, time, MAC address, and other information. The packets are received at a number of stations, distributed throughout the monitoring zone, which can measure the received signal strength. Based on the location of stations and data collected at the stations, the movement of pedestrian traffic can be analyzed. This information can be used to improve the services, such as better bus schedule time and better pavement design. In addition, this paper presents a signal strength based localisation method.</span>

<span class="f2">+Smartphones with Wi-Fi enabled periodically transmit Wi-Fi messages, even when not associated to a network. In one 12-hour trial on a busy road (average daily traffic count 37,000 according to the state DOT), 7,000 unique devices were detected by a single road-side monitoring station, or about 1 device for every 5 vehicles.</span>
<span class="f2">+In this paper, we describe a system for passively tracking unmodified smartphones, based on such Wi-Fi detections. This system uses only common, off-the-shelf access point hardware to both collect and deliver detections. Thus, in ad- dition to high detection rates, it potentially offers very low equipment and installation cost.</span>
<span class="f2">+However, the long range and sparse nature of our oppor- tunistically collected Wi-Fi transmissions presents a signif- icant localization challenge. We propose a trajectory es- timation method based on Viterbi’s algorithm which takes second-by-second detections of a moving device as input, and produces the most likely spatio-temporal path taken. In addition, we present several methods that prompt passing de- vices to send additional messages, increasing detection rates an use signal-strength for improved accuracy.</span>
<span class="f2">+Based on our experimental evaluation from one 9-month deployment and several single-day deployments, passive Wi- Fi tracking detects a large fraction of passing smartphones, and produces high-accuracy trajectory estimates.</span>

<span class="f2">+New streams of data are being generated by a range of in-situ instrumentation, mobile sensing, and social media that can be integrated and analyzed to better understand urban activity and mobility patterns. While several studies have focused on understanding flows of people throughout a city, these data can also be used to create a more spatially and temporally granular picture of local population, and to forecast localized population given some exogenous environmental or physical conditions. Effectively modeling population dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions would have significant implications for city operations and policy, strategic long-term planning processes, emergency response and management, and public health.</span>
<span class="f2">+This paper develops a real-time census of the city using Wi-Fi data to explore urban phenology as a function of localized population dynamics. Using Wi-Fi probe and connection data accounting for more than 20,000,000 data points for the year 2015 from New York City's Lower Manhattan neighborhood – combined with correlative data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey, the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics survey, and New York City administrative records – we present a model to create real-time population estimates classi- fied by residents, workers, and visitors/tourists in a given neighborhood and localized to a block or geolocation proximate to a Wi-Fi access point. The results indicate that the approach has merit: we estimate intra-day, hourly worker and resident population counts within 5% of survey validation data. Our building-level test case demon- strates similar accuracy, estimating worker population to within 1% of the reported building occupancy.</span>

<span class="f2">+With the explosive growth and wide-spread use of smartphones with Wi-Fi enabled, people are used to accessing the internet through Wi-Fi network interfaces of smartphones. Smartphones periodically transmit Wi-Fi messages, even when not connected to a network. In this paper, we describe the Mo-Fi system which monitors and aggregates large numbers of continuous Wi-Fi message transmissions from nearby smartphones in the area of interest using nonintrusive Wi-Fi sniffer sensors. In this paper, we propose an optimized Wi-Fi channel detection and selection method to switch the best channels automatically to aggregate the Wi-Fi messages based on channel data transmission weights and human presence activity classification method based on the features of human dwell duration sequences in order to evaluate the user engagement index. By deploying in the real-world office environment, we found that the performance of Wi-Fi messages aggregation of CAOCA and CACFA algorithms is over 3.8 times higher than the worst channel of FCA algorithms and about 76% of the best channel of FCA algorithms, and the human presence detection rate reached 87.4%.</span>
