\chapter{Processing the Data into Footfall} \label{chapter:processing}
%===============================================================================%

Chapter \ref{chapter:collection} explains the collection of 3 distinct Wi-Fi probes based datasets ranging from small controlled experiments to comprehensive national level project.
It also details the various uncertainties, biases and challenges that are present in these datasets and possible approaches to solve them.
Having established these, this chapter aims to device the toolkits and methods and combine them into a data processing pipeline to go through the data and convert them to estimation of ambient population or footfall at the locations they were collected.

As the amount of data collected with Smart street sensor project is large from a conventional computing point of view, Section \ref{section:toolkit} starts with a review of `big data' and tries to set up a framework of evaluating the datasets from a `big data' perspective.
Above 3 datasets were evaluated in each of their dimensions to understand their nature and the challenges posed in these dimensions.
After evaluating the datasets, it goes on to a detailed review of tools and methods to deal with data of such size and picks out the ones which are relevant and feasible for this research.
It concludes by putting together a complete bespoke toolkit which combines all the individual tools so that it can process the data in the most efficient way.

Section \ref{section:processing} explores the methods that can be used to 

Finally in section \ref{section:pipeline}
