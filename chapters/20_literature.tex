\chapter{Review of Literature}
Understanding the scale, nature and dynamics of distribution of population in space and time has been a central premise of academic research in various fields of study such as human geography, sociology, urban planning and architecture.
This granular knowledge of where people are and how they move is critical in practical decision making in various industries such as real estate for valuing places, retail for business planning and emergencies for risk management and evacuation.
The first challenge in any of these research is collecting precise and accurate data.
This started as research into methods estimating and interpolating highly granular data from existing regional level aggregate datasets and as the technology improved through the later half of twentieth century, the research methodologies adopted the new technologies to utilise these more granular sources of data.
Though new technologies provide immense opportunity in collecting large amounts of data which were previously impossible they also introduce their share of uncertainties.
Hence it becomes imperative that we understand the evolution of these techniques and methodologies along with the research that used them to build our rationale behind any further research.

Moreover with the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless internet connectivity, even day to day activities are being digitised leading to the creation  of large amount of easily accessible data which are generated passively in an unstructured manner.
The users' acceptance to the collection and analysis of such data has also been improving until recently \cite{kobsa2014user}.
There has also been rising concerns regarding user privacy along with the development of more accurate methods to track them.
In this context, the critical task in all these research is to solve the problem of balancing these two by choosing the right technologies and devising the appropriate methods.

In this chapter we conduct a systematic survey of literature in this broad area of `distribution and dynamics of human activity'.
The aim of this survey is to evaluate where we are at the research and understand how we got here.
First we conduct a comprehensive survey of over 300 publications which discuss this area of research and we then look at the major themes and trends in the last 70 years.
We discuss these themes in detail looking at the aims and achievement of these research while highlighting the opportunities and gaps they leave.
We also look at the timeline of their publication and discuss the evolution of the research along with the changes in the technology landscape.
We then classify the studies by looking at the technologies employed by them and note the trends in the adoption and phasing out of relevant technologies.
We also try and understand the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques and develop a theoretical framework to understand when and how to use them effectively answer research questions.
Finally we summarise the literature survey focussing on the major gaps still left in our understanding and the new, emerging areas where more research is necessary.
We also critically evaluate these areas of research in terms of priority and feasibility to develop our research questions and devise a plan for our research.
