\chapter{Review of Literature}

Understanding the scale, nature and dynamics of distribution of population in space and time has been a central premise of research in various academic fields such as human geography, sociology and urban planning.
This knowledge is also extremely critical for practical decision making in various industries such as real estate for valuing places, retail for business planning and emergency management to do risk management and evacuation.
The major challenge in these research lies in the collection and estimation of detailed and granular data that is as precise and as accurate as possible without being disclosive.
The proliferation of personal mobile devices has generated considerable interest for research in the past two decades by opening up unprecedented avenues in gathering detailed, granular information on people carrying these devices.
Since 1950s, the technology landscape that supports this device ecosystem has also been constantly evolving along with the usersâ€™ acceptance to collection of such data \cite{kobsa2014user}.
In this chapter we conduct a detailed survey of literature in this topic and we seek the hierarchy of ideas explored and the evolution of techniques and technology used in the previous literature.
