\chapter{Review of Literature}

Understanding the scale, nature and dynamics of distribution of population in space and time has been a central premise of academic research in various fields of study such as human geography, sociology, urban planning and architecture.
This granular knowledge of where people are and how they move is critical in practical decision making in various industries such as real estate for valuing places, retail for business planning and emergencies for risk management and evacuation.
The primary challenge in these research is collecting precise and accurate data.
As the technology improved through the later half of twentieth century, the research methodologies adopted the new technologies to utilise better sources of data.
It becomes imperative that we understand the evolution of these techniques and methodologies to build a rationale behind any further research in the area.
Moreover the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless internet connectivity lead to the availability of large amount of easily accessible data which can be collected passively.
The users' acceptance to the collection and analysis of such data has also been improving until recently \cite{kobsa2014user}.
There has also been rising concerns regarding user privacy along with the development of more accurate methods to track them.
In this context, the critical task in all these research is to solve the problem of balancing these two by choosing the right technologies and devising the appropriate methods.

In this chapter we conduct a detailed survey of literature in this broad area of `measuring distribution and dynamics of human activity'.
First we conduct a comprehensive survey of over 300 publications which discuss this area of research and we then look at the major themes and trends in the last 70 years.
We discuss these themes in detail and their evolution along with the technology landscape
Then we group the studies by looking at the technologies employed by them and note the trends in the adoption and phasing out of relevant technologies.
We also try and understand the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques and develop a theoretical framework to understand when and how to use them effectively answer research questions.
Finally we summarise the literature search to focus on the major gaps still left in our understanding and the new and emerging areas where more research is necessary. We also critically evaluate these areas of research to form our broad research question and devise a plan for our research.
