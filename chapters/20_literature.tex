Understanding the scale, nature and dynamics of distribution of population across space and time has been the central premise of academic research in various fields of study such as human geography, sociology, transportation, urban planning and managements.
This granular knowledge of where people are and how they move is also critical in practical decision making in various industries such as real estate for valuing places, retail for business planning and risk management during emergencies for evacuation.
The primary challenge faced by any research concerning the population at this scale is the collection of precise and accurate data in a timely manner.
Though large structured datasets such as national census provides comprehensive coverage they are sparse temporally and understanding dynamics of population withing shorter periods is not possible.
Alternatively, smaller datasets such as sample surveys and traffic counts are collected more frequently they are not comprehensive enough. 
This pursuit for identifying a data source which has the best features of both type of datasets started as an inquiry into methods to estimate and interpolate highly granular data from existing regional level aggregate data.
As technology improved through the later half of twentieth century, research methodologies adopted the new tools and technologies to not only improve the quality of estimations but also to collect data with high granularity.
Though new technologies provided immense opportunity in collecting large amounts of data which were previously impossible, they also introduced their own share of uncertainties.
Hence it becomes imperative that we understand the evolution of these techniques and methodologies along with the research that used them to build our rationale behind any further research.
Moreover with the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless internet connectivity, every day to day activity is being digitised leading to the creation of large amount of easily accessible data which are generated passively in an unstructured manner.
The users' acceptance to the collection and analysis of such data has also been improving until recently \cite{kobsa2014}.
There has also been rising concerns regarding user privacy along with the development of more accurate methods to track them.
In this context, the critical task in all these research is to solve the problem of balancing these two - collecting relevant data and protecting user privacy, by choosing the right technologies and devising the appropriate methods.

In this chapter a systematic survey of literature in the broad multidisciplinary area of research - `distribution and dynamics of human activity' has been conducted.
The aim of this survey was to evaluate the stage at which the research is currently at, understand its evolution and progress through time and identify the possibilities that exists for future research.
A comprehensive survey of over 300 publications which discuss this area of research was undertaken covering the major themes and trends in the last 70 years.
These themes were discussed in detail to outline what has been achieved in the corresponding fields of study highlighting the opportunities and gaps in research that still exist.
The timeline of publication of these research has also been studied to discuss the evolution of the research along with the changes in the technology landscape.
These studies were then classified in terms of the major technologies employed by them to uncover the trends in how various technologies have been adopted and phasing out during this period.
The primary objective was to understand the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques and to develop a theoretical framework for understanding when and how to use them effectively to answer research questions.
Finally the literature survey was summarised focussing on the major research gaps that still exist and interesting new areas of research that has emerged recently  where more research is warranted.
These areas of research were also critically evaluated in terms of priority and feasibility leading to the development of questions and plan for this research thesis.

The set of works which discuss the use of mobile devices based technologies for studying topics in disciplines such as geography \citet{li2016}, urban analysis \citep{ratti2006}, urban computing \citep{jiang2013} and other general applications and opportunities \citep{steenbruggen2013, arribas-bel2014}, serve as our starting point for this literature survey.
The search was then expanded from these reviews by navigating through their citation networks and identifying further research that are relevant.
Though this did not provide a perfectly comprehensive set of literature, it did provide a representative sample of all the different disciplines and directions of the research conducted in the area.
Through this process, around 325 relevant research publications were identified which dealt with the collection, measurement, analysis, visualisation and discussion of population and their movement at a granular level.
Research in this area started around 1950s where possibility of estimating day-time urban population at a granular level using existing  broader data employing various estimation methods were discussed \cite{foley1954, schmitt1956}.
Though this served as a starting point, the pursuit of such granular data and their applications in corresponding fields didn't pick up until the start of the 21st century during the `digital revolution' when personal computing become mainstream which was followed by the growth of internet.
Figure \ref{figure:literature:timeline} shows the yearly volume of research published since 1980 from which it can be observes that though there were some research conducted through 80s and 90s the real push forward came around beginning of the millennium when mobile phones adoption skyrocketed.
In addition to the early 2000s, a substantial increase in interest can also be seen in the beginning of the next decade fuelled by the smartphone revolution which completely changed the research avenues in-terms of volume and types of data available and methodologies available to tackle them.
While the mobile phone era put a device in every ones pockets, the smart phone era has armed them with immense data collection capabilities.
The area of research is multidisciplinary encompassing academic interest and commercial applications in various disciplines and industries spanning across wide range of themes as discussed in section \ref{section:literature:themes}.
