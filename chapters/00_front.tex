\section*{Abstract} 
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Measuring the distribution and dynamics of population at granular level both spatially and temporally is crucial in our understanding of the structure and function of built environment.
In this era of big data there have been numerous attempts at tackling this pursuit using the dearth of unstructured, passively collected, incidental data generated by day to day human activities.
In such ever growing attempts to collect, analyse and link these widely available datasets, we can also easily put privacy of the study subjects at risk.
In this research look at one such data - Wi-Fi probe requests generated by mobile devices in detail and process them into a granular, long term footfall information on retail high streets of United Kingdom (UK).
Though this is not the first study to use this dataset in this research, we specifically target and tackle the uncertainties that arose in recent years from implementing features protecting the privacy of the users. In this research, we design and conduct multiple experiments looking at the Wi-Fi probe requests in detail, instrument a data collection method and collect multiple sets of probe requests at locations across London. We use this along with the data generated from over 1000 locations in UK through the Smart Street Sensor project to devise novel data cleaning and processing methodologies which leads a data set of sufficient quality on footfall retail high streets of UK at 5 minute intervals for the past 3.5 years. While doing these we also put together a bespoke `Medium data toolkit' for processing data with similar size and complexity. Finally put together multiple case studies showcasing the applications of such footfall data. Through out the research we have tried and successfully avoided the use of any personal information thus keeping privacy of the user as the primary priority.

\section*{Impact Statement}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We live in the age of data deluge where the data is generated at a pace that far exceeds our capacity to digest and analyse them.
Putting these vast amount of data to use while when constrained by resources and time is one of the biggest challenges faced by researchers today.
This research's primary impact on solving this issue.
This research picks one such vast data - Wi-Fi signals, generated by millions of mobile phones all around the year and available to anyone with a Wi-Fi receiver and cleans and processes it into highly granular and longitudinal information on footfall at retail areas in UK.

In this research, to convert the unstructured data into useful information, two novel methods were developed - one for filtering the Wi-Fi signals based on their strength and the other for grouping them based on the device that generated them both without actually revealing the identity of the users.
These techniques can be used with similar datasets exhibiting similar challenges such as Bluetooth signals, people's clicks as they navigate through websites etc.
These methodologies and their results have been published under a peer reviewed journal IJGIS for use by the wider community.
They were also presented back to the data partner who worked with research unit for data collection and were considered for inclusion in the data partner's commercial project.
When dealing with the large and complex Wi-Fi dataset, we also researched, designed and implemented a bespoke toolkit and a data processing pipeline comprising of open source and free software which could be used by other researchers for use with similar data.
The work on this `Medium-data toolkit' was presented at Geographic Information Science Research UK conference with positive feedback.
Moreover the research directly led to the creation and maintenance of the footfall data product with Consumer Data Research Center (CDRC)\sidenote{\textit{\url{https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/local.data.company.ucl.smartstreetsensor.footfall.data.research.aggregated.data}}} and has served as the data source for multiple research projects within and outside CDRC and UCL.

Apart from the technical impact, the primary output of the research - Footfall information on retail locations, has commercial and policy impact on all the stakeholders involved with retail industry in UK. 
From this information, the retailers get insights on the patterns of customer movement around their shops; the landlords get a reliable way to value their properties; local authorities get a way to quantify the vibrancy of their retail centers; and the customers get information on which areas might be crowded at a given time.
Finally, in the past 3 years, the outputs from this research have been disseminated to the broader academic community and industry through a series of paper presentations at conferences such as \textit{GIS Research UK} and \textit{Conference of Complex Systems}, talks at \textit{Data natives}, \textit{Geo+Data London} and \textit{Smart Urban Policy Futures Workshop}, industry events such as \textit{Oxford Retail Futures Conference} and public engagement events such as the \textit{Big Data Here} exhibition.
