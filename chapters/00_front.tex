\begin{abstract}
 - data is everywhere but no information
 - need to understand population in detail
 - this research connects this two quests
 - Wi-Fi probes in built environment = detailed footfall information
 - we conduct experiments collect two sets of data.
 - we process the data with different methods to get footfall
 - we establish the application of the data with series of examples
\end{abstract}

\begin{impact_statement}
 - we live in era of explosion of data.
 - everyone is looking for ways to use data
 - this research looks in to one such data set
 - deals with collection, processing and application.
 - we develop a open-source toolkit for doing all the above
 - the research resulted in publications
 - Outputs with C.D.R.C and subsequent use of the data 
 - methods communicated to data partner for industry application 
 - \citep{gandomi2015beyond}
