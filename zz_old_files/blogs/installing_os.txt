I have been reading a lot about installing Operating systems recently. Since I moved to ArchLinux, I have been interested in getting a linux system setup even more minimally to suit my needs. I just want a linux system which is as small as possible with nothing but the software I want (which is not much to begin with). When I started with installing Operating systems, it was Windows XP. I had a desktop. I understood the boot process. interrupting the regular boot to boot from installation medium (CD) and click next to everything that is being asked. Then I realised there are places you can install your operating system to (partitions and physical disks). It stayed this way for a long time.
