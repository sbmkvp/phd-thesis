Random thoughts and actions:

This one is supposed to be the distraction free writing things. I need to be able to write a lot of words and passages without getting distracted with things. The overall interface of vim is minimal but it does leave a lot to be desired. I also need to make sure all my work is interchangeable. Properly set up and made to be OK without a major hassle.

The organisation of my masters thesis did give me some ideas on how it can be done in the future.

This is great this laptop is fast sleek and feature complete. I can use all the hardware with minimum setup hassle. There are some security issues but hey possession is 60% of security. And I am not going to have anything super important on this anyways.
