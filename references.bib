 abstract = {<p>This chapter intends to address the problem of how to estimate human activities in retail centres by examining the WiFi probes in a SmartStreetSensors network at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. These sensors capture signals sent by WiFi-enabled devices present in their range. The data are then used as a proxy for estimating footfall at retail locations. An original methodology for cleaning and validating probe requests and then converting them into actual footfall counts is proposed and implemented. With these counts, a national level footfall index is proposed and, finally, the chapter concludes with a case study to use</p>},
