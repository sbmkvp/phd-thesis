This paper reports on our investigation of the aggregate patterns of urban mobility in Rome, Italy for which we used novel data from a mobile phone operator. Unlike research that chartered urban mobility through individual travel surveys, our research determined the aggregate distribution of Rome's population over time by using the volume of call activity in mobile network cells as the unit of spatial analysis. In this paper, we first illus- trate and confirm that there is significant regularity in urban mobility at different hours, days, and weeks. We then show how mobility between network cells differs at various times, and we account for the differences by using demographic, economic, and (built) environment indicators.},

Virtual geography is not merely Cyberspace per se for it comprises many types of place and space in which the digital world finds expression. We define cspace—the space within computers, cyberspace—the use of computers to communicate, and cyberplace—the infrastructure of the digital world, as key components of what Castells1 refers to as ‘real virtuality'. Virtual geography is all this as well as the study of these worlds from traditional geographic perspectives. Like all classifications, the interesting questions lie at the boundaries between classes—between espace and cyberspace, cyberspace and cyberplace, and between all of these.

  abstract = {The massive spread of mobile phones and their social acceptance is an important information-technological feature of the beginning of the 21st century. In addition to making calls, mobile phones are associated with various additional services and games, which are becoming part of everyday life. As the location of mobile phones can be precisely tracked in space, they can be used for investigating the space-time behaviour of society. In this paper we will introduce the Social Positioning Method and its possible applications in the organisation and planning of public life. The Social Positioning Method (SPM) studies social flows in time and space by analysing the location coordinates of mobile phones and the social identification of the people carrying them. So far, relatively few SPM surveys have been carried out - The reason for that is related to people's anxieties about the idea of being tracked, as well as technical aspects. In this article we assert that SPM will become very wide-spread in the future and will fundamentally change public life and administration. Due to the widespread use of telephones and the possibilities of social positioning, the questions of privacy and freedom of the individual are already being discussed. Despite this, there has still been only a limited discussion concerning live-map geography and real-time planning in relation to privacy issues. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {"We live today in a period of intense and puzzling transformation, signalling perhaps a move beyond the industrial era altogether. Yet where are the great sociological works that chart this transition? Hence the importance of Manuel Castells' multivolume work, in which he seeks to chart the social and economic dynamics of the information age . . . [It] is bound to be a major reference source for years to come." (Anthony Giddens, The Times Higher Education Supplement) "A brief review cannot do it j ustice. No other scholar has approached the subject of the information age in as engaging and innovative a way as this author. Strongly recommended for academic libraries." (Choice) A little over a decade since its first publication, the hypotheses set out in Manuel Castells' groundbreaking trilogy have largely been verified. In a substantial new preface to the first volume in the series, Castells demonstrates, in the light of major world trends, how the network society has now fully risen on a global scale. The book discusses how the global economy is now characterized by the almost instantaneous flow and exchange of information, capital, and cultural communication. These flows order and condition both consumption and production. The networks themselves reflect and create distinctive cultures. Both they and the traffic they carry are largely outside national regulation. Our dependence on the new modes of informational flow gives to those in a position to control them enormous power to control us. The main political arena is now the media, and the media are not politically answerable. Based on research in the USA, Asia, Latin America, and Europe, Castells formulates a systematic theory of the information society and details the new social and economic developments brought by the Internet and the "new economy."},

The effectiveness of the proposed prediction model is tested using a massive mobile phone location dataset available for the Boston metropolitan area. Experimental results show good levels of accuracy in terms of prediction error and prove the advantage of using the collective behavior in the prediction model.},

The mobile-phone-based mobility measures are compared to mobility measures computed using odometer readings from the annual safety inspections of all private vehicles in the region to check the validity of mobile phone data in characterizing individual mobility and to identify the differences between individual mobility and vehicular mobility. The empirical results can help us understand the intra-urban variation of mobility and the non-vehicular component of overall mobility. More importantly, this study suggests that mobile phone trace data represent a reasonable proxy for individual mobility and show enormous potential as an alternative and more frequently updatable data source and a compliment to the conventional travel surveys in mobility study.},

@article{louail2014,
  abstract = {Pervasive infrastructures, such as cell phone networks, enable to capture large amounts of human behavioral data but also provide information about the structure of cities and their dynamical properties. In this article, we focus on these last aspects by studying phone data recorded during 55 days in 31 Spanish metropolitan areas. We rst de ne an urban dilatation index which measures how the average distance between individuals evolves during the day, allowing us to highlight di erent types of city structure. We then focus on hotspots, the most crowded places in the city. We propose a parameter free method to detect them and to test the robustness of our results. The number of these hotspots scales sublinearly with the population size, a result in agreement with previous theoretical arguments and measures on employment datasets. We study the lifetime of these hotspots and show in particular that the hierarchy of permanent ones, which constitute the `heart' of the city, is very stable whatever the size of the city. The spatial structure of these hotspots is also of interest and allows us to distinguish di erent categories of cities, from monocentric and "segregated" where the spatial distribution is very dependent on land use, to polycentric where the spatial mixing between land uses is much more important. These results point towards the possibility of a new, quantitative classi cation of cities using high resolution spatio-temporal data.},

We used mobile phone usage data recorded in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as a proxy for urban activity to test whether the density in different forms of urban land use increases the level of activity in urban areas, and whether mixed land uses can prolong high levels of activity in an area. Our results indicate that higher densities correspond with higher activity levels, mixed land uses do indeed diversify urban activity dynamics and colocating particular land uses prolongs high activity levels in the evening hours. We proceed to demonstrate that mixed activity provisions and high urban activity levels coincide with urban neighbourhoods that are considered attractive places in which to live and work, while lower activity levels and markedly low activity mixes coincide with neighbourhoods that are considered disadvantaged.},

Two-thirds of the region's employment, however, is outside any of the 32 centers we identify. Most centers have high population densities in and near them, and their workers' commutes are just 2.4 miles longer than other workers' commutes. A cluster analysis of employment by industry reveals several distinct types of centers, and a wide dispersion of sizes and locations within each type. ?? 1991.},

The results show that generalized job dispersion was a more common spatial process than subcentering during the 1980s and 1990s when jobs continued to decentralize from the metropolitan core to the suburbs. Three distinctive patterns of spatial development were found. Job dispersion was predominant in Portland and Philadelphia, whereas the polycentricity of Los Angeles and San Francisco was further reinforced. New York and Boston with large and long-established CBDs were less prone to decentralization. Each metro seems to have developed a unique pattern of decentralization in light of their histories and circumstances, which has limited the growth of commuting times. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing, Inc. 2007.},

Against this research backdrop the mobile phone network offers a compelling compromise between these extremes: it is both highly mobile and yet still localisable in space. Moreover, the mobile phone's enormous and enthusiastic adoption across most socioeconomic strata makes it a uniquely useful toot for conducting large-scale, representative behavioural research. In this paper we attempt to connect telecoms usage data from Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) to a geography of human activity derived from data on commercial premises advertised through Pagine Gialle, the Italian 'Yellow Pages'. We then employ eigendecomposition-a process similar to factoring but suitable for this complex dataset-to identify and extract recurring patterns of mobile phone usage. The resulting eigenplaces support the computational and comparative analysis of space through the tens of telecommuniations usage and enhance our understanding of the city as a 'space of flows'.},

@article{batty2005,
  abstract = {As urban planning moves from a centralized, top-down approach to a decentralized, bottom-up perspective, our conception of urban systems is changing. In Cities and Complexity, Michael Batty offers a comprehensive view of urban dynamics in the context of complexity theory, presenting models that demonstrate how complexity theory can embrace a myriad of processes and elements that combine into organic wholes. He argues that bottom-up processes in which the outcomes are always uncertain can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities. Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata. He then introduces agent-based models (ABM), in which agents are mobile and move between locations. These models relate to many scales, from the scale of the street to patterns and structure at the scale of the urban region. Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments. Every theory and model presented in the book is developed through examples that range from the simplified and hypothetical to the actual. Deploying extensive visual, mathematical, and textual material, Cities and Complexity will be read both by urban researchers and by complexity theorists with an interest in new kinds of computational models.},

We represent this structure by the principal components of the complete behavioral dataset, a set of characteristic vectors we have termed eigenbehaviors. In our model, an individual's behavior over a specific day can be approximated by a weighted sum of his or her primary eigenbehaviors. When these weights are calculated halfway through a day, they can be used to predict the day's remaining behaviors with a 79{\%} accuracy for our test subjects. Additionally, we show that users of a similar demographic can be clustered into a “behavior space” spanned by a set of their aggre- gate eigenbehaviors. These behavior spaces make it possible to determine the behav- ioral similarity between both individuals and groups, enabling 96{\%} classification accu- racy of group affiliations. This approach capitalizes on the large amount of rich data previously captured during the Reality Mining study from mobile phones continuously logging location, proximate people, and communication of 100 subjects at MIT over the course of nine months},

This question is largely unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale society-wide data that simultaneously capture the dynamical information on indi- vidual movements and social interactions. Here we address this challenge for the first time by tracking the trajecto- ries and communication records of 6 Million mobile phone users. We find that the similarity between two individuals' movements strongly correlates with their proximity in the social network. We further investigate how the predictive power hidden in such correlations can be exploited to ad- dress a challenging problem: which new links will develop in a social network. We show that mobility measures alone yield surprising predictive power, comparable to traditional network-based measures. Furthermore, the prediction accu- racy can be significantly improved by learning a supervised classifier based on combined mobility and network measures. We believe our findings on the interplay of mobility patterns and social ties offer new perspectives on not only link pre- diction but also network dynamics. Categories},

  abstract = {While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.},

The paper has four parts. First, I briefly review the loosely integrated body of research on city-telecommunications relations and highlight the tendency of much contemporary research to adopt futuristic metaphors for explaining such relations at a general level. In part two, the argument that the current explosion of telecommunications applications across all aspects of urban development challenges old urban paradigms, for understanding and planning urban space, is developed. Four challenges are identified and explored: the challenge of invisibility, the conceptual challenge, the challenge to urban planning, and the challenge of containment. Given this context, the third part of the paper builds on recent insights in cultural studies to explore the potential for new conceptual frameworks which help explain the new relations between telecommunications, time, space, and advanced industrial cities.},

Mobile telephones have been rapidly accepted throughout the urban world, particularly in countries with far lower levels of Internet use. While mobile telephones are sold as a technology that helps conquer constraints of location and geography, it is increasingly apparent that the time-management capabilities of this new tool are equally important. As a result, the widespread use of these devices is quickening of the pace of urban life and at an aggregate level, resulting in a dramatic increase in the metabolism of urban systems. This quickening metabolism is directly tied to the widespread formation of new decentralized information networks facilitated by this new technology. As a result, new paradigms for understanding the city and city planning in a decentralized context are discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze statistical properties of a communication network constructed from the records of a mobile phone company. The network consists of 2.5 million customers that have placed 810 million communications (phone calls and text messages) over a period of 6 months and for whom we have geographical home localization information. It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k- 5 and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases as d- 2, where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper seeks to conceptualize and explore the changing relationships between planning action and practice and the dynamics of place. It argues that planning practice is grappling with new treatments of place, based on dynamic, relational constructs, rather than the Euclidean, deterministic, and one-dimensional treatments inherited from the 'scientific' approaches of the 1960s and early 1970s. But such emerging planning practices remain poorly served by planning theory which has so far failed to produce sufficiently robust and sophisticated conceptual treatments of place in today's globalizing' world. In this paper we attempt to draw on a wide range of recent advances in social theory to begin constructing such a treatment. The paper has four parts. First, we criticize the legacy of object-oriented, Euclidean concepts of planning theory and practice, and their reliance on 'containered' views of space and time. Second, we construct a relational understanding of time, space and cities by drawing together four strands of recent social theory. These are: relational theories of urban time-space, dynamic conceptualizations of 'multiplex' places and cities, the 'new' urban and regional socio-economics, and emerging theories of social agency and institutional ordering. In the third section, we apply such perspectives to three worlds of planning practice: land use regulation, policy frameworks and development plans, and the development of 'customized spaces' in urban 'regeneration'. Finally, by way of conclusion, we suggest some pointers for practising planning in a relational way.},

@article{massey1992,
  abstract = {Space' is very much on the agenda these days. On the one hand, from a wide variety of sources come proclamations of the significance of the spatial in these times: ‘It is space not time that hides consequences from us' (Berger); ‘The difference that space makes' (Sayer); ‘That new spatiality implicit in the postmodern' (Jameson); ‘It is space rather than time which is the distinctively significant dimension of contemporary capitalism' (Urry); and ‘All the social sciences must make room for an increasingly geographical conception of mankind' (Braudel). Even Foucault is now increasingly cited for his occasional reflections on the importance of the spatial. His 1967 Berlin lectures contain the unequivocal: ‘The anxiety of our era has to do fundamentally with space, no doubt a great deal more than with time.' In other contexts the importance of the spatial, and of associated concepts, is more metaphorical. In debates around identity the terminology of space, location, positionality and place figures prominently. Homi Bhabha, in discussions of cultural identity, argues for a notion of a ‘third space'. Jameson, faced with what he sees as the global confusions of postmodern times, ‘the disorientation of saturated space', calls for an exercise in ‘cognitive mapping'. And Laclau, in his own very different reflections on the ‘new revolution of our time', uses the terms ‘temporal' and ‘spatial' as the major differentiators between ways of conceptualizing systems of social relations. In some ways, all this can only be a delight to someone who has long worked as a ‘geographer'. Suddenly the concerns, the concepts (or, at least, the terms) which have long been at the heart of our discussion are at the centre also of wider social and political debate. And yet, in the midst of this gratification I have found myself uneasy about the way in which, by some, these terms are used. Here I want to examine just one aspect of these anxieties about some of the current uses of spatial terminology: the conceptualization (often implicit) of the term ‘space' itself.},

  abstract = {Land-use classification is essential for urban planning. Urban land-use types can be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as reflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have been recognized as a vital method for urban land-use classification because of their ability to capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although significant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for urban land-use classification, most techniques focus on physical characteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used. Owing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which can be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to indicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the opportunity to derive land-use information from mobile phone data. To verify the application of this new data source to urban land-use classification, we first construct a vector of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize land-use types. This vector is composed of two aspects: the normalized hourly call volume and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means clustering approach is then applied to infer the land-use types. The method is validated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is determined with a detection rate of 58.03{\%}. An analysis of the land-use classification results shows that the detection rate decreases as the heterogeneity of land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers increases.},

We have developed a software probe that can be implemented on a user's mobile phone, and which allows the joint recording and collection of the successive locations experienced by the user (through the identification of the cell in which the mobile phone is located) and all types of communicative acts performed through the mobile phone. This has been combined to indepth interviews with subjects over one week of their mobility and mobile communication behaviour. The method has been tested over a sample of 24 adults living in Paris, all in the 30–45 age range, half male and half female, with varying histories of mobility and professional flexibility constraints, in order to reconstruct their mobility and their communication-based activity spaces. We show how such a method enables the construction of a long time perspective on mobilities, and particularly on the articulation of displacements and mobile communication, which is an important issue in the ‘new mobilities paradigm'. We show how, over longer periods, mobility and communication practices combine into patterns marking social integration (or disintegration). We also show how our method allows us to construct new types of indicators, such as the propensity to communicate from a given type of place per unit of time, that reveal underlying patterns such as a higher propensity to call in mobile situations and transitory locations. This type of approach may be particularly relevant to the ongoing convergence of transport and communication studies, and to bridge the gap between communication research and mobility studies.},

  abstract = {Smartphones with Wi-Fi enabled periodically transmit Wi-Fi messages, even when not associated to a network. In one 12-hour trial on a busy road (average daily traffic count 37,000 according to the state DOT), 7,000 unique devices were detected by a single road-side monitoring station, or about 1 device for every 5 vehicles. In this paper, we describe a system for passively tracking unmodified smartphones, based on such Wi-Fi detections. This system uses only common, off-the-shelf access point hardware to both collect and deliver detections. Thus, in addition to high detection rates, it potentially offers very low equipment and installation cost. However, the long range and sparse nature of our opportunistically collected Wi-Fi transmissions presents a significant localization challenge. We propose a trajectory estimation method based on Viterbi's algorithm which takes second-by-second detections of a moving device as input, and produces the most likely spatio-temporal path taken. In addition, we present several methods that prompt passing devices to send additional messages, increasing detection rates an use signal-strength for improved accuracy. Based on our experimental evaluation from one 9-month deployment and several single-day deployments, passive Wi- Fi tracking detects a large fraction of passing smartphones, and produces high-accuracy trajectory estimates.},

It is opening the way to a wide range of applications, collectively referred to as Location Based Services (LBS), that are primarily aimed at individual users. However, if deployed to retrieve aggregated data in cities, LBS could become a powerful tool for urban analysis. This paper aims to review and introduce the potential of this technology to the urban planning community. In addition, it presents the ‘Mobile Landscapes' project: an application in the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, based on the geographical mapping of cell phone usage at different times of the day. The results enable a graphic representation of the intensity of urban activities and their evolution through space and time. Finally, a number of future applications are discussed and their potential for urban studies and planning is assessed.},

In particular, mobile phone datasets offer access to insights into urban dynamics and human activities at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, representing a huge opportunity for research and real-world applications. This article surveys the new ideas and techniques related to the use of telecommunication data for urban sensing. We outline the data that can be collected from telecommunication networks as well as their strengths and weaknesses with a particular focus on urban sensing. We survey existing filtering and processing techniques to extract insights from this data and summarize them to provide recommendations on which datasets and techniques to use for specific urban sensing applications. Finally, we discuss a number of challenges and open research areas currently being faced in this field. We strongly believe the material and recommendations presented here will become increasingly important as mobile phone network datasets are becoming more accessible to the research community.},

In this paper, we provide a foundation for such work by exploring mobility characteristics in traces of mobile users. We present a method to estimate the physical location of users from a large trace of mobile devices associating with access points in a wireless network. Using this method, we extracted tracks of always-on Wi-Fi devices from a 13-month trace. We discovered that the speed and pause time each follow a log-normal distribution and that the direction of movements closely reflects the direction of roads and walkways. Based on the extracted mobility characteristics, we developed a mobility model, focusing on movements among popular regions. Our validation shows that synthetic tracks match real tracks with a median relative error of 17{\%}.},

Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93{\%} potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.},

However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job-housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs-housing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.},

Dasymetric modeling has been a well-recognized approach for spatial decomposition of census data to increase the spatial resolution of population distribution. However, enhancing the temporal resolution of population distribution poses a greater challenge. In this paper, we discuss the development of LandScan USA, a multi-dimensional dasymetric modeling approach, which has allowed the creation of a very high-resolution population distribution data both over space and time. At a spatial resolution of 3 arc seconds (∼90 m), the initial LandScan USA database contains both a nighttime residential as well as a baseline daytime population distribution that incorporates movement of workers and students. Challenging research issues of disparate and misaligned spatial data and modeling to develop a database at a national scale, as well as model verification and validation approaches are illustrated and discussed. Initial analyses indicate a high degree of locational accuracy for LandScan USA distribution model and data. High-resolution population data such as LandScan USA, which describes both distribution and dynamics of human population, clearly has the potential to profoundly impact multiple domain applications of national and global priority.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for a quick, simple method to represent diurnal population change in metropolitan areas for effective emergency management and risk analysis. Many geographic studies rely on decennial U.S. Census data that assume that urban populations are static in space and time. This has obvious limitations in the context of dynamic geographic problems. The U.S. Department of Transportation publishes population data at the transportation analysis zone level in fifteen-minute increments. This level of spatial and temporal detail allows for improved dynamic population modeling. This article presents a methodology for visualizing and analyzing diurnal population change for metropolitan areas based on this readily available data. Areal interpolation within a geographic information system is used to create twenty-four (one per hour) population surfaces for the larger metropolitan area of Salt Lake County, Utah. The resulting surfaces represent diurnal population change for an average workday and are easily combined to produce an animation that illustrates population dynamics throughout the day. A case study of using the method to visualize population distributions in an emergency management context is provided using two scenarios: a chemical release and a dirty bomb in Salt Lake County. This methodology can be used to address a wide variety of problems in emergency management.},

Through a diverse range of sensor and automation technologies -- combined with existing data generated through administrative records, surveys, social media, and mobile sensors -- information on human, physical, and environmental elements can be processed in real-time to better understand the interaction and effects of the built environment on human well-being and outcomes. The goal is to create an “informatics overlay” that can be incorporated into future urban development and planning that supports the benchmarking and evaluation of neighborhood conditions, provides a test-bed for measuring the impact of new technologies and policies, and responds to the changing needs and preferences of the local community.},

  abstract = {We present several novel techniques to track (unassociated) mobile devices by abusing features of the Wi-Fi standard. This shows that using random MAC addresses, on its own, does not guarantee privacy. First, we show that information elements in probe requests can be used to fingerprint devices. We then combine these fingerprints with incremental sequence numbers, to create a tracking algorithm that does not rely on unique identi-fiers such as MAC addresses. Based on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly track as much as 50{\%} of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also show that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scram-bler seeds. These can be used to improve the performance of our tracking algorithm. Finally, we present two attacks that reveal the real MAC address of a device, even if MAC ad-dress randomization is used. In the first one, we create fake hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real MAC address. The second technique relies on the new 802.11u standard, commonly referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we show that Linux and Windows send Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) requests using their real MAC address.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

  abstract = {There is much enthusiasm currently about the possibilities created by new and more extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities. Here, I explore how big data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general computational problem. I show that, under general conditions, new sources of data coordinated with urban policy can be applied following fundamental principles of engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems. I also show, that comprehensive urban planning is computationally intractable (i.e. practically impossible) in large cities, regardless of the amounts of data available. This dilemma between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved by the recognition that cities are first and foremost self-organizing social networks embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management that encourages, and does not stifle, the fundamental role of cities as engines of development and innovation in human societies.},

These approaches can provide detailed information about urban behaviors, but they're hard to update and might limit results to "snapshots in time." In the past few years, some innovative approaches have sought to use mobile devices to collect spatiotemporal data. But little research has been done to develop and analyze the much larger samples of existing data generated daily by mobile networks. The most common explanation for this is that the challenge of data-sharing with the telecommunications industry has hampered data access. However, in early 2006, a collaboration between Telecom Italia, which serves 40 percent of the Roman market, and MIT's SKNSEable City Laboratory (http://senseable.mit.edu) allowed unprecedented access to aggregate mobile phone data from Rome.

In this work, we analyze an activity-based travel survey conducted in the Chicago metropolitan area over a demographic representative sample of its population. Detailed data on activities by time of day were collected from more than 30,000 individuals (and 10,552 households) who participated in a 1-day or 2-day survey implemented from January 2007 to February 2008. We examine this large-scale longitudinal data in order to explore three critical issues: (1) the inherent daily activity structure of individuals in a metropolitan area, (2) the variation of individual daily activities?how they grow and fade over time, and (3) clusters of individual behaviors and the revelation of their related socio-demographic information. We find that the population can be clustered into 8 and 7 representative groups according to their activities during weekdays and weekends, respectively. Our results enrich the traditional divisions consisting of only three groups (workers, students and non-workers) and provide clusters based on activities of different time of day. The generated clusters combined with social demographic information provide a new perspective for urban and transportation planning as well as for emergency response and spreading dynamics, by addressing when, where, and how individuals interact with places in metropolitan areas.},

Remotely sensed imagery, road network, and parcels are the three most commonly used ancillary data for areal interpolation of population. Meanwhile, the open access geographic data generated by social networks is emerging as an alternative control data that can be related to the distribution of population. This study evaluates the effectiveness of geo-located night-time tweets data as ancillary information and its combination with the three commonly used ancillary datasets in intelligent areal interpolation. Due to the skewed Twitter user age, the other purpose of this study is to test the effect of age bias control data on estimation of different age group populations. Results suggest that geo-located tweets as single control data does not perform as well as the three other control layers for total population and all age-specific population groups. However, the noticeable enhancement effect of Twitter data on other control data, especially for age groups with a high percentage of Twitter users, suggests that it helps to better reflect population distribution by increasing variation in densities within a residential area delineated by other control data.},

Work activities are detected from smartcard transactions. To link the observed work activities to buildings, linear programming techniques are applied to minimize walking times between transit stops and workplaces. Work activities are classified in work schedules obtained by clustering methods. Information on building areas is combined with estimates on individual work space to define maximum capacities. To account for private transport user workers, mode shares as observed in a travel diary are obtained. To demonstrate the applicability, the method is applied to Singapore and the results critically reviewed.},

Since a large proportion of pedestrians nowadays carry mobile phones, visual observation methods of the past could give way to cell-tower and WiFi based capture of passers-by, optionally augmented by aggregated or anonymized demographic data about them coming from their service providers. A major mobile phone operator recently announced the introduction of such a service in Germany, the U.K. and Brazil, but had to cancel its plans for Germany since the revelation caused nationwide privacy uproar. We conducted an exploratory interview study to gauge whether and under what conditions German consumers would accept if their mobile phone providers disclosed their personal data to retail stores they walk by, in aggregated and anonymized individual form. Virtually all respondents wanted their data to remain private at an extent that goes considerably beyond the protections afforded by current privacy laws. Nearly everyone however also indicated an interest in financial incentives in return for their consent to the transfer of their data, and many of them at seemingly very reasonable terms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

  abstract = {There has been extensive research on active safety systems in the ITS community in recent years that has significantly contributed to reducing traffic accidents. However, further reduction is needed, especially on residential roads, where the reduction rate of traffic accidents is still quite small. On residential roads, traffic accidents are caused primarily by pedestrians suddenly running in front of cars and by the inattention of drivers to such risks. Automatic emergency braking systems activated by pedestrian detection are not always reliable on residential roads due to physical limitations such as too short a braking distance. To overcome the limitations of current active safety management systems, we focus on risk anticipation and defensive driving, key ideas to ensure safety on residential roads. Since defensive driving requires careful deceleration in advance of barrier lines and the corners of streets, long-term driver behavior prediction is needed. In this work, we provide a new framework of modeling risk anticipation and defensive driving with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In contrast to conventional driver behavior models such as hidden Markov models and maximum-entropy Markov models, our framework using IRL ensures accurate long-term prediction of driver maneuvers since the IRL is based on the Markov decision process (MDP), a goal-oriented path planning framework. Because the predicted defensive driver behaviors obtained by an MDP are appropriate only when the reward functions are carefully designed, we use inverse reinforcement learning, where the normative behavior of expert drivers is leveraged to optimize the reward functions. In addition to the proposed formulation of defensive driving with IRL, we provide new feature descriptors for computing reward functions to represent risk factors on residential roads such as corners, barrier lines, and speed limitations. Experimental results using actual driver maneuver data over 20 km of residential roads indicate that our approach is successful in terms of providing precise learning models of risk anticipation and defensive driving. We also found that the behavior models obtained by expert/inexperienced drivers are helpful for determining the factors in risk anticipation and defensive driving.},

Heterogeneous map merging is a crucially important problem for scenarios where multiple heterogeneous robots collaborate to provide situational awareness in urban search and rescue, patrolling, and explorations tasks, just to name a few. To remedy the lack of uniform representation between heterogeneous map models, we rely on the ubiquitous presence of WiFi signals in today's environments. Our solution consists of three steps. First, the overlap between the heterogeneous maps being merged is determined. Second, metric correspondences between overlapping parts are established. Third, the merging is improved by exploiting the structural properties inherent to graph-based maps. Our proposed system is validated using various occupancy grid and appearance-based maps built in real-world conditions, the results of which confirm its strengths.

The core idea is that legitimate and undesired users may have different physical constraints, e.g., moving area, walking path, etc, leading to different signal sequences. NiFi analyzes and exploits the characteristics of signal sequences generated by mobile devices. NiFi proposes a practical and effective method to extract useful features and measure similarity for signal sequences, while not relying on precise user location information. We implement NiFi on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) APs, and the implementation does not require any modification to user devices.

The intuition is that due to the differences in gaits of different people, the WiFi signal reflected by a walking human generates unique variations in the Channel State Information (CSI) on the WiFi receiver. To profile human movement using CSI, we use signal processing techniques to generate spectrograms from CSI measurements so that the resulting spectrograms are similar to those generated by specifically designed Doppler radars. To extract features from spectrograms that best characterize the walking pattern, we perform autocorrelation on the torso reflection to remove imperfection in spectrograms. We evaluated WifiU on a dataset with 2,800 gait instances collected from 50 human subjects walking in a room with an area of 50 square meters. Experimental results show that WifiU achieves top-1, top-2, and top-3 recognition accuracies of 79.28{\%}, 89.52{\%}, and 93.05{\%}, respectively.},

Focusing on Wi-Fi, we study the privacy issues and potential missuses that can affect the owners of wireless-enabled portable devices. Wi-Fi enable-devices periodically broadcast in plain-text their unique identifier along with other sensitive information. As a consequence, their owners are vulnerable to a range of privacy breaches such as the tracking of their movement and inference of private information (Cunche et al. in Pervasive Mobile Comput, 2013; Greenstein in Proceedings of the 11th USENIX workshop on hot topics in operating systems, pp 10:1‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}10:6. USENIX Association, Berkeley, 2007). As serious as those information leakage can be, linking a device with an individual and its real world identity is not a straightforward task. Focusing on this problem, we present a set of attacks that allow an attacker to link a Wi-Fi device to its owner identity. We present two methods that, given an individual of interest, allow identifying the MAC address of its Wi-Fi enabled portable device. Those methods do not require a physical access to the device and can be performed remotely, reducing the risks of being noticed. Finally we present scenarios in which the knowledge of an individual MAC address could be used for mischief.},

We take a minimum infrastructure approach and thus utilize a single monitor placed close to the service area along with transmitting phones. Our strategy extracts unique features embedded in the signal traces to infer the critical time points when a person reaches the head of the queue and finishes service, and from these inferences we derive a person's waiting and service times. We develop a feature driven approach in our system. Extensive experiments conducted both in the laboratory demonstrate that our system is robust to queues with different waiting time.

  abstract = {Abstract To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance to our understand- ing of urban dynamics, and essential to city and transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research has revealed universal regularities atmainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales.We demonstrate this by comparing reg- ularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all tempo- ral scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various character- istics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for themanagement of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.},

This paper presents an approach to learning and inferring user presence status on smartphones using the available context data with a goal to enable non intrusive and energy-efficient maintenance of presence status without user intervention. We apply the Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) data set collected during the Lausanne Data Collection Campaign from October 2009 until March 2011 in our evaluations.},

The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs, such as mobile phones) has introduced new data sources for modeling human activities. Based on the scattered spatiotemporal points provided in mobile phone datasets, it is feasible to study the patterns (e.g., the scale, shape, and regularity) of human activities. In this paper, we propose methods for analyzing the distribution of human activity space from both individual and urban perspectives based on mobile phone data. The Weibull distribution is utilized to model three predefined measurements of activity space (radius, shape index, and entropy). The correlation between demographic factors (age and gender) and the usage of urban space is also tested to reveal underlying patterns. The results of this research will enhance the understanding of human activities in different urban systems and demographic groups, as well as providing novel methods to expand the important and widely applicable area of geographic knowledge discovery in the age of instant access.},

The major challenges include antenna characteristics, environment's complexity and scanning features. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are compared in this paper in terms of architecture, discovery time, popularity of use and signal strength. Type of antennas used and the environment's complexity such as trees for outdoor and partitions for indoor spaces highly affect the scanning range. The aforementioned challenges are empirically evaluated by “real” experiments using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Scanners. The issues related to the antenna characteristics are also highlighted by experimenting with different antenna types. Novel scanning approaches including Overlapped Zones and Single Point Multi-Range detection methods will be then presented and verified by real-world tests. These novel techniques will be applied for location identification of the MAC IDs captured that can extract more information about people movement dynamics.},

Intelligence agencies exploit information obtained from the analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous data deriving from various informative sources including the records of phone traffic, the social networks, surveillance data, interview data, experiential police data, and police intelligence files, to acquire knowledge about criminal networks and initiate accurate and destabilizing actions. In this context, visual representation techniques coordinate the exploration of the structure of the network together with the metrics of social network analysis. Nevertheless, the utility of visualization tools may become limited when the dimension and the complexity of the system under analysis grow beyond certain terms. In this paper we show how we employ some interactive visualization techniques to represent criminal and terrorist networks reconstructed from phone traffic data, namely foci, fisheye and geo-mapping network layouts. These methods allow the exploration of the network through animated transitions among visualization models and local enlargement techniques in order to improve the comprehension of interesting areas. By combining the features of the various visualization models it is possible to gain substantial enhancements with respect to classic visualization models, often unreadable in those cases of great complexity of the network.},

In this study, we apply a dasymetric approach using the Heuristic Sampling Method for 2010 parcel data to disaggregate population counts from the 2010 U.S. Census into a quadrilateral grid composed of 30??30mcells covering the Alachua County, Florida. The final output, termed the High-resolution Gridded Population Surface (HGPS), is compared to a land cover-based population product (LCPP) and the detail of each product is assessed. Results suggest that the HGPS provides increased spatial heterogeneity and more detail in the boundaries of populated areas over the use of census blocks or land cover lots. For an example of the final output, we use a case study at the Cabot-Koppers Superfund Site to demonstrate the advantages of the HGPS over the LCPP. The HGPS is expected to serve as a more accurate input in various research fields, such as public health, crime analysis, and climate change. The approach outlined provides an improved means of producing spatially-explicit population grids where fine-scale ancillary data, such as parcel data, is available. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Issue Title: SPATIO-TEMPORAL ASPECTS AND DIMENSIONS IN INTEGRATED DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT: CURRENT APPROACHES AND FUTURE CHALLENGES   In recent years, uses of high-resolution population distribution databases are increasing steadily for environmental, socioeconomic, public health, and disaster-related research and operations. With the development of daytime population distribution, temporal resolution of such databases has been improved. However, the lack of incorporation of transitional population, namely business and leisure travelers, leaves a significant population unaccounted for within the critical infrastructure networks, such as at transportation hubs. This paper presents two general methodologies for estimating passenger populations in airport and cruise port terminals at a high temporal resolution which can be incorporated into existing population distribution models. The methodologies are geographically scalable and are based on, and demonstrate how, two different transportation hubs with disparate temporal population dynamics can be modeled utilizing publicly available databases including novel data sources of flight activity from the Internet which are updated in near-real time. The airport population estimation model shows great potential for rapid implementation for a large collection of airports on a national scale, and the results suggest reasonable accuracy in the estimated passenger traffic. By incorporating population dynamics at high temporal resolutions into population distribution models, we hope to improve the estimates of populations exposed to or at risk to disasters, thereby improving emergency planning and response, and leading to more informed policy decisions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The rapid deployment of smartphones as all-purpose mobile computing systems has led to a wide adoption of wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in mobile scenarios. Both communication systems leak information to the surroundings during operation. This information has been used for tracking and crowd density estimations in literature. However, an estimation of pedestrian flows has not yet been evaluated with respect to a known ground truth and, thus, a reliable adoption in real world scenarios is rather difficult. With this paper, we fill in this gap. Using ground truth provided by the security check process at a major German airport, we discuss the quality and feasibility of pedestrian flow estimations for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth captures. We present and evaluate three approaches in order to improve the accuracy in comparison to a naive count of captured MAC addresses. Such counts only showed an impractical Pearson correlation of 0.53 for Bluetooth and 0.61 for Wi-Fi compared to ground truth. The presented extended approaches yield a superior correlation of 0.75 in best case. This indicates a strong correlation and an improvement of accuracy. Given these results, the presented approaches allow for a practical estimation of pedestrian flows.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright 2015 ACM.Pedestrian flow analysis using Wi-Fi packet sensors can easily collect the movement trajectories of individuals, has a high-resolution sensing ability, and is well suited to indoor operations. Thus it is regarded as one of the promising sensing technologies for Smart Cities targeting a variety of applications such as disaster prevention, the planning of commercial and barrier-free facilities, and monitoring people with disabilities. However, because Wi-Fi packet sensors cannot detect devices that have disabled their Wi-Fi functionality or people with no Wi-Fi devices, they can only probabilistically estimate the number of people in a target area. We conducted a two-month field experiment in a shopping mall, and derived a coefficient for estimating the actual number of people in the area by comparing the number of recognized devices in the mall, as counted by Wi-Fi packet sensors, with data from motion detectors placed at all of the mall's entrances and exits. In the calculation process, we separated the collected data into weekdays and holidays by considering the visiting patterns, and calculated an estimation coefficient   for the actual number of people. This gives the least absolute error between the observed values given by the Wi-Fi packet sensors and hourly data of motion detectors over the course of a week. The accuracy of   is evaluated by comparing known data from the motion detectors with the estimated people numbers calculated from the Wi-Fi packet sensor data. As a result, we demonstrate that the maximum error in the number of people in the mall for each hour, accumulated over a day, is less than 7.9{\%}.},

This is done through WiFi Probe requests ¿¿¿ special wireless frames that contain the MAC address of the sending device and, in most of the cases, the human-readable name-string (SSID) of the known AP. This semantic information, inherent to the network protocol, is sent in the clear and, if sniffed, can help discover important information and phenomena of people and human nature that have nothing to do with technology. In this paper we present the idea of exploiting WiFi probe requests to de-anonymize the origin of participants in large events. We make use of several, publicly available datasets containing more than 11M of probe requests collected in scenarios that are of citywide, national (two political meetings), and international religion-related relevance. We show how, by exploiting the semantic information brought by the relative WiFi probes, we are able to discover with high accuracy the provenance of the crowds in each event. In particular, the de-anonymization outcome of the two political meetings held few days before the election days in Italy match surprisingly well the official voting results reported for the two respective parties.},

Because they periodically scan for nearby access points, Wi-Fi devices act as portable radio beacons emitting short messages, called probe requests. The latter contain a unique identifier: the MAC address of the Wi-Fi interface. It can be used to passively track individuals. Owners of such devices are thus exposed to passive tracking in the physical world. MAC address randomization has been proposed as a way to prevent passive tracking, and is being progressively adopted by the industry. However, the MAC address is not the only piece of information that can be used for tracking.

We show that 96{\%} of students own at least one of these mobile IT devices (i.e., a laptop, tablet, or smartphone). Using econometric modelling, we also show that student income, parental income, gender, immigrant parents, and household type (e.g., living with parents) have a statistically significant but small effect on mobile IT device ownership. The demand for tablets is relatively income inelastic, and the demand for laptops and smartphones extremely so. Therefore ownership rates are high for all student groups, including lower income students. However, students leave their laptops (and tablets) at home most of the time, mainly because they find it cumbersome to carry a laptop, and the vast majority of students hold the opinion that abolishing computer labs while facilitating laptop use is a bad idea, despite the didactical advantages this may have during lectures. Thus, it appears that the current high ownership rates of mobile IT devices by no means imply students' preference or support for university Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The actual OD matrices are derived by scaling up these node-to-node transient OD matrices. An optimization based approach, in conjunction with a microscopic traffic simulation platform, is used to determine the scaling factors that result best matches with the observed traffic counts.

By comparing whole cities typical patterns, we provide insights on how cultural, technological and economical factors shape human dynamics. At a more local scale, we use clustering analysis to identify locations with similar patterns within a city. Our research reveals a universal structure of cities, with core financial centers all sharing similar activity patterns and commercial or residential areas with more city-specific patterns. These findings hint that as the economy becomes more global, common patterns emerge in business areas of different cities across the globe, while the impact of local conditions still remains recognizable on the level of routine people activity.},

Current measures of human mobility, especially in low-income settings, are often static, relying on approximate travel times, road networks, or cross-sectional surveys. Mobile phone data provide a unique source of information about human travel, but the power of these data to describe epidemiologically relevant changes in population density remains unclear. Here we quantify seasonal travel patterns using mobile phone data from nearly 15 million anonymous subscribers in Kenya. Using a rich data source of rubella incidence, we show that patterns of population travel (fluxes) inferred from mobile phone data are predictive of disease transmission and improve significantly on standard school term time and weather covariates. Further, combining seasonal and spatial data on travel from mobile phone data allows us to characterize seasonal fluctuations in risk across Kenya and produce dynamic importation risk maps for rubella. Mobile phone data therefore offer a valuable previously unidentified source of data for measuring key drivers of seasonal epidemics.},

In particular, numerous recent studies have lead to an unexpected consensus: the considerable variability in the characteristic travelled distance of individuals coexists with a high degree of predictability of their future locations. Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and GPS data, we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes, we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings. Finally, we show that returners and explorers play a distinct quantifiable role in spreading phenomena and that a correlation exists between their mobility patterns and social interactions.},

Previous human mobility studies have typi-cally been built upon empirical single-source data (e.g., cellphone or transit data), which inevitably introduces a bias against residents not contributing this type of data, e.g., call detail records cannot be obtained from the resi-dents without cellphone activities, and transit data cannot cover the residents who walk or ride private vehicles. To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel ar-chitecture mPat to explore human mobility using multi-source data. A reference implementation of mPat was developed at an unprecedented scale upon the urban infrastructures of Shenzhen, China. The novelty and uniqueness of mPat lie in its three layers: (i) a data feed layer consisting of real-time data feeds from 24 thousand vehicles, 16 million smart cards and 10 million cellphones; (ii) a mobility abstraction layer exploring the correlation and divergence among the multi-source data to analyze and infer human mobility; and (iii) an application layer to improve urban efficiency based on the human mobility findings of the study. The evaluation shows that mPat achieves a 75{\%} inference accuracy, and that its real-world application reduces passenger travel time by 36{\%}.},

@article{deville2014,
  abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotem- poral distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estima- tions of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also dem- onstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applica- tions and a near real-time understanding of patterns and pro- cesses in human geography.},

  abstract = {Pervasive presence of location-sharing services made it possible for researchers to gain an unprecedented access to the direct records of human activity in space and time. This article analyses geo-located Twitter messages in order to uncover global patterns of human mobility. Based on a dataset of almost a billion tweets recorded in 2012, we estimate the volume of international travelers by country of residence. Mobility profiles of different nations were examined based on such characteristics as mobility rate, radius of gyration, diversity of destinations, and inflow–outflow balance. Temporal patterns disclose the universally valid seasons of increased international mobility and the particular character of international travels of different nations. Our analysis of the community structure of the Twitter mobility network reveals spatially cohesive regions that follow the regional division of the world. We validate our result using global tourism statistics and mobility models provided by other authors an...},

Such dynamics can be monitored and modelled using data from mobile phone operators regarding mobile telephone usage. Using such an extensive dataset from the city of Amsterdam, this paper introduces space-time explanatory models of aggregated human activity patterns. Various modelling experiments and results are presented, which demonstrate that mobile telephone data are a good proxy of the space-time dynamics of aggregated human activity in the city.},

  abstract = {<p>This chapter intends to address the problem of how to estimate human activities in retail centres by examining the WiFi probes in a SmartStreetSensors network at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. These sensors capture signals sent by WiFi-enabled devices present in their range. The data are then used as a proxy for estimating footfall at retail locations. An original methodology for cleaning and validating probe requests and then converting them into actual footfall counts is proposed and implemented. With these counts, a national level footfall index is proposed and, finally, the chapter concludes with a case study to use</p>},
